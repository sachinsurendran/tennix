    Tennix 0.7.0 "Deine Eltern sind auf einem Tennixturnier"
    
    Updated README and manpage. Made sure tennix.tnx is
    installed in the right spot, and that the binary can
    find the data file either in the current directory or
    in the installed location.
    
    Push version to 0.7.0 and display version and URL in
    the main screen (as with previous versions).

    Only redraw the referee when its state changes
    
    Same principle as with the score string - remember the
    last "position" of the referee and if it has changed,
    redraw the back buffer. This saves a lot of painting.

    Only redraw game score strings when necessary
    
    Do not redraw the score strings every time the
    render() method is called, but only when the text
    really changes (using a flag in the GameState).

    Add "--benchmark/-b" command line switch
    
    When starting tennix with "--benchmark" or "-b", the
    game will start in "AI vs. AI" mode for a limited
    number of seconds. This can be used for benchmarking
    different optimizations.

    After loading of graphics and sound, make sure to
    unload the allocated resources, because RWops does
    not seem to free the resources, even if told so.

    Loading progress bar, add missing header files, Maemo
    
    Add a progress bar while loading resources (graphics
    and sound) from the datafile.
    
    Add some missing "#include" lines (scratchbox complained).
    
    Do not make the "hovering" sound on Maemo (touchscreen!)

    Cache width and xposition in get_font_metrics
    
    To save some cycles, do not re-calculate the font
    metrics every time a string is drawn, but save the
    width and xposition permanently after the first
    calculation to speed up font drawing.

    Use Tennix Archive Format instead in-executable data
    
    This makes the binary smaller, and we can free the
    raw game data once the resources have been loaded.
    
    Also, it makes recompiling easier. The data file is
    currently named "tennix.tnx" and will be auto-built.

    Voice support, experimental wind, extended referee
    
    Add support for playing back voice tracks if voice
    files are available (have to enable with "DELUXE=1").
    
    Includes experimental support for in-game wind (you
    can modify its direction with "1" and "2").
    
    Add support for the extended referee mode if the
    extended referee resources are available (DELUXE=1).

    Correct sounds (enable the racket/ground sounds)
    
    Make sure that we are able to correctly shuffle between
    the different racket sounds by fixing the calculation and
    also making sure that the audience clapping stops after
    the ball is served (range check instead of C macro).

    Make sure FPS limit in the main menu is always correct
    
    Without this patch, after the gameloop has finished, we
    won't have reset the FPS counter, so the FPS limiter
    will be practically disabled, depending on how long you
    played.
    
    With this patch, the FPS limit counter is reset after
    the gameloop has finished, so we always have a correct
    way of calculating FPS. This can probably be improved.

    Fix a bug with negative offsets in fill_image_offset()
    
    When negative values for offset_x or offset_y have been
    passed to fill_image_offset(), the result wasn't correct.
    
    Fix this by translating negative offsets to positive values.

    More in-game weather (fog) + fill_image_offset() function
    
    Add support for having in-game fog clouds to make gameplay
    harder. This needed an addition of the offset to the fill_image
    function, so we have this now too, allowing arbitrary offsets
    to shift the repeated image on the start for a moving effect.

    no multiplayer menu item (not chooseable, anyway).
    
    Also: Add mappings for all hardware keys on the
    Nokia N800 Internet Tablet (Fullscreen, increase and
    decrease, the "menu" button and the dpad "enter").
    
    Note in README that we now support Maemo and add a

    to compile a Tennix package for Maemo.

    Fix mouse control, add mouse rectangle, enable mouse by default
    
    Fix problems with mouse control (lock the mouse if
    we are using the keyboard). This makes the mouse
    control work nicely together with the keyboard control,
    so we enable mouse control by default now.
    
    Draw a mouse rectangle on the screen so the user knows
    what's going on when using mouse control. This should
    make playing Tennix a bit easier with the mouse, because
    the racket is always sloppy (you can move the mouse faster
    than you can move the racket.

    Apply patch from Enrico Zini to improve ball movement
    
    From the mail:
    if I understood correctly, the position of the ball is
    updated, then the keyboard events are read, then the
    screen is redisplayed. It should be instead: the screen
    is redisplayed, then keyboard events are read and handled,
    then the ball position is updated: that way the keyboard
    event is connected with what is on the screen, which is
    what the player would expect.

    Fix and improve mouse input, initialize players correctly
    
    Improve mouse input to work alongside keyboard input
    and change the way mouse input works (press and hold
    to move the racket, release to swing the racket).
    
    Initialize the "Player" structs in game.c correctly,
    so we don't get compile warnings and so that our
    variables for each player are initialized sanely.

    Make graphics more faster by only updating the
    parts of the UI that have to be redrawn (this
    could still be optimized, but works well so far).
    
    Add support for mouse/touchscreen. The mouse and
    touchscreen support will not be enabled in Desktop
    builds but will be enabled for handheld devices
    like the Nokia Internet Tablets.

    evening. It's still not finished, but a future Tennix
    release should probably have its menu to look something
    like this draft (tennix-side-menu.xcf).

    but replace it with the correct tennix version when building
    the "Tennix.app" Mac OS X application.

    Support for BINARY_INSTALL_DIR, Makefile updates
    
    After a suggestion by a package maintainer, the makefile
    now supports the "BINARY_INSTALL_DIR" variable which can
    be used to specify an alternative install dir for Unix-like
    systems. This can be used to install the "tennix" binary in
    /usr/games on Debian-based systems.
    
    The makefile has been updated to more directly remove some
    files in the clean target, so all temporary files get removed.

    Joystick support (via command line); better keyboard controls
    
    Enable more keyboard controls for Player 1 (arrow keys, space,
    left control) and enable the usage of a joystick when the user
    specifies the name of the joystick as command line argument.
    
    This even works with applesmc on Linux, so you can play and
    control Tennix by tilting your Apple MacBook and pressing the
    left control key, which is now mapped to Player 1 swing racket.

    Sound rework, background music, image_id/sound_id
    
    Rework the sound system to strip sound playing from the
    game logic and move it into the "display"/"render" code.
    
    Add free background music to menu from MelodyLoops.
    Convert sound samples to OGG Vorbis to save space.
    Sound panning (left, right) for the "racket hit" sound.

    select if she wants to run tennix in fullscreen or not.
    
    Add a resource file for the dialog box layout and the
    Win32-specific icon (our executable now has an icon!).
    
    New .iss installer script (InnoSetup) that will compile
    a standalone exe installer from the tennix binaries.

    algorithm to "catch" the ball.
    
    A simple ngram-based ball position predictor has
    been added, so the computer AI can move based on
    previous ball movements to have a better chance
    of catching the ball.

    When loading graphic resources, use black color key

    Add font_draw_string_alpha() to draw fonts w/ opacity
    and add font_draw_string() macro (opacity=255).
    
    Add a neat, opacity-based text scroller to the main

    and convert grass texture from old court + add new textures:
     - Clay (red/orange-ish) and
     - Hard (concrete-looking grey)
    
    Don't call SDL_SetColorKey() for loaded images anymore, because
    we're now using RGBA PNG files instead of "black-is-alpha" BMPs.
    
    Removed introimage() function as it's not used anywhere.

    Don't allow the player to hit the ball with the racket when
    an "out" state has been reached. The ball will fly-by the
    racket even with the racket swung at the time of impact.
    
    Disallow keeping the "swing racket" button permanently
    pressed, but add a lock to disallow re-swinging the rack when
    the corresponding key has not been released yet.

    João Pinto pointed out that Tennix will not compile when
    not using bash as /bin/sh, as the makefile in data/ will
    complain about bad substitution.
    
    This has been worked around by making data2csrc generating
    the variable name on-the-fly if the variable name is not
    passed as second command line argument.

    will then be included and compiled into the binary. This
    makes Tennix run without the "data" folder, and the game
    resources (sounds and data) cannot simply be edited for the
    binary distribution.
    
    Added first cut of button drawing routines which can be
    useful for menu navigation later on. (including text)
    
    Fix space character in Smallish font.

    width, image height, sprite width, simplified char search.
    
    New draw_line_faded() method that draws a line with faded
    colors, fixed old draw_line() code and make draw_line() a
    macro that calls draw_line_faded().
    
    Add support for quitting tennix by closing the tennix window.
    
    Elektrons beatified, added faded line drawing. Move around
    items in the menu, remove sound + racket animation.
    
    Fade to black the menu when quitting.

    This is Tennix 0.3.3, adding the first version of our dynamic
    text engine, which enables us drawing animated bit-mapped fonts
    to the screen. Currently used in menus and as gameplay status.
    
    This also disables loading the custom icon (SDL_WM_SetIcon)
    when Tennix is ran on Mac OS X, as Tennix on OS X already has a
    beatiful icon and OS X doesn't display per-window icons.

    Improve AI player movement to make the game livelier :)
    
    Fade between two scores and block input (both human and
    AI input) while the scene is being faded to add a smooth
    crossfade between scores. Don't wait for keypresses as
    before.

    Compile-time debug mode, get_move_y gameplay fixes
    
    Added compile-time DEBUG variable to enable or disable
    debugging code (currently position visualisation) and
    added dest1/dest2 variables to the Ball struct.
    
    Fix return value and handling in get_move_y() to have
    smoother gameplay and better ball movement control.
