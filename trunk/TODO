Todo and Idea List for Tennix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ideas/suggestions from our Debian maintainer:
 -> Make options menu same style as main menu
 -> add picture to left side of main menu

basic user experience testing results:
 * Fix "hit area" for racket -> make outside areas also hit the ball or
                                add a sound to make it audible that the
                                ball hit the edge area of the racket.
 * Give a visual clue where the ball goes when serving

Effects/weather:
 * Wind (modifies the ball movement)
 * Snow (christmas edition?)
 * Sunshine (=current, normal behaviour)

For the next UI clean-up, use "Wild plastic" as music from:
