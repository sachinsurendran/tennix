ABOUT
=====

   This is the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) port of Tennix!, a 
   game written by Thomas Perl in 2003. This version has been up-
   scaled to a resolution of 640x480 in comparison to the 320x200 
   format used in the original game.

   Changes from the original Tennix to the first SDL release include
   a new shadow, advanced alpha blending and the removal of the 
   previously-included pseudo-advertisements.

   For all changes, please see the ChangeLog file.

   This port has been written on the 10th of May 2007 and is now 
   being improved and updated since then.


INSTALLATION
============

   To build tennix, simply run "make" (on Unix-like systems) or 
   follow the instructions for your platform in the README.* files.

   Tennix is known to build on Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 (etch), 
   Win32 (mingw32), Mac OS X 10.4 (using XCode tools) and in
   the Maemo 4.0 SDK (for Nokia Internet Tables, IT OS2008).

   Binaries of Tennix can be found on the webpage.


PLAYING TENNIX
==============

   You can play in either single-player or multi-player mode. 
   For single player, Player 1 will play against the computer 
   and for multi player, Player 1 will play against Player 2.

   CONTROLS

                         Player 1   |   Player 2
                       ---------------------------
   Move up                  W              O
   Move down                S              L
   Swing racket             D              K
                       ---------------------------

   See the manpage, tennix(6) for more controls (especially alternative
   keyboard controls and mouse control, which is new since 0.6.0).

   FUNCTION KEYS

   Y  .... Make screenshot (save as screenshot.bmp)
   F  .... Toggle fullscreen (X11 only)
   C  .... Switch type of court (grass, clay, etc..)

   Bonus (because you took the time to look at the README file):
   Obviously, there are some hidden easter eggs that are still not available
   via the UI, due to the fact that we didn't implement the UI for it yet :)
   Think about [n]ight, [r]ain and fog (think fog[t], even..). Wind is also
   available, but it's so broken, you'll have to look up the keys in game.c.


DEVELOPMENT/DEBUGGING
=====================

   If you want to compile a debugging version of "tennix", you
   have to set the environment variable "DEBUG" to "1", either by
   using "DEBUG=1 make" or exporting the environment variable for
   the current session, as in "export DEBUG=1" followed by "make".
